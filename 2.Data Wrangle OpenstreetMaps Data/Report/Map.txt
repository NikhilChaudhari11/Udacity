Introduction: The community is a college town, dominated economically and demographically by the presence of the University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University (from Wikipedia). I choose this area because I personally have been there once to join NE Chinese Soccer Tournament in Penn State University last year. It's a quaint, rustic place.
